- **Name:** The project name
- **Description:** Provide a short explanation of your project. The search bar will look for keywords in this section.
- **Public:** This is the visibility setting. Checked On means anybody on the Tercen server can see it. The project will be visible in the **Explore** section of Tercen. Unchecking the setting means only the owner (Person or Team) can see it.

A project is a repository for the elements of a data analysis. It contains Data Tables, Files, and Workflows.
